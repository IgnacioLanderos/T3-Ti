He scrambles toward them,\nthe ship groaning as it lists sideways.\nOxen and deer are visible on the far side of the deck,\nbacklit by emergency lights; Pi hears monkeys screeching, the\nclatter of hoofs pounding. In the distance, Sailors shout\norders in panicked voices.\nPi comes onto the lower deck, where he sees three men - the\nBuddhist (Taiwanese Sailor) from the dining hall; the\nJAPANESE CAPTAIN, and SAILOR #1 - arguing with the French\ncook, who has climbed into the stern of one of the lifeboats\nthat hangs off the side of the ship. Pi runs to the Captain.\nPI (CONT'D)\nPlease save my family!\nJAPANESE CAPTAIN\nDon't scare. Okay?

They\npush Pi over the edge; Pi falls onto the lifeboat, bouncing\non the protective tarp that is still stretched taut across\nthe bow. He grabs at the rope holding the bow, trying not to\nslip off. The sailors are shouting at the French cook, who\nstands at the stern.\nSAILOR #1\nHey! You! What are you doing?!\nFRENCH COOK\nLoosen the lines! Bring it down!\nSAILOR #1\nTie it down! Tie it down!\nFRENCH COOK\n(to the sailors:)\nJump! Jump!\nThe sailors look towards the upper deck. Pi follows their\nlooks and watches in horror as a zebra launches itself over\nthe side of the ship, careening through the air toward the\nsafety of the lifeboat. The French cook staggers backward and\njumps out of the way, falling to the water below. Pi throws\nup his arms as the life boat starts to drop. The zebra arcs\nthrough the air, missing the tarp, landing on the exposed\nstern with a sickening thud, shattering the rear bench. The\nforce sends the rig lines spinning.\nThe lifeboat plummets to the water below. The impact spins it\naround, nearly washing Pi overboard.

He tips his head back.\nPi's POV - above and behind him, the tops of trees.\nPi turns, looking at the island, amazed. The trees have a\npale bark with an amazing profusion of leaves, their color\nburning with a neon-like intensity. There is no sand; instead\nthe ground is an intricate, tightly webbed mass of tube-\nshaped seaweed, about two fingers in diameter.\nPi turns to look back to the stern; he calls under the tarp.\nPI\nRichard Parker?\n61.\nPi rises, stepping out of the boat. The seaweed is rubbery -\nuncertain ground. His legs are wobbly. He hooks the gaff on a\nroot and falls to the ground. Pi tears up a piece of the\nseaweed and examines it. He takes an experimental bite. Soon\nhe's grabbing handfuls of the seaweed, eating as fast as he\ncan."

THE DARK FOREST - DAY\nPuss keeps SCREAMING. Then he opens his eyes, blinks, and\nrealizes that he's sitting on the forest floor beside Kitty\nand Dog. They're staring off in wonder.\nPUSS\nWhoa...\nThey've arrived in THE DARK FOREST. It's a place of\nenchantment, full of technicolor trees and rivers that\nsparkle with stardust. Truly magical.\nKITTY\nFor a dark forest, this place is\npretty colorful. I wish I had my\nquinceaera here.\nPUSS\n(standing up)\nThe Wishing Star is in here\nsomewhere.\nPuss dusts himself off, turns to Kitty, forces a smile.\n0\nPUSS (CONT'D)\n(sweetly)\nKitty, may I please see the map?\nKITTY\nNo.\nPUSS\nSeriously?

They're getting bigger!\nOh, Kitty, you gotta trust\nhim...Look at those eyes!\nKITTY\nReally? You call that cute?\nKitty flashes her own CUTE-EYES at Puss. Puss staggers. It's\na CUTE-EYES stare-off for the ages!\nDOG\nOh! Look at her! Those eyes are\neven bigger than yours! Do whatever\nshe wants, Puss!\nPuss answers back with even cuter cuteness, fluffing up his\nbeard.\nDOG (CONT'D)\nOhhh, wait a second! So poofy!\nKitty starts making biscuits with her paws.\nDOG (CONT'D)\nNo! With the paws! Come on--\n1\nPuss raises his game, striking a charming pose, raising his\nhat to his chest.\nDOG (CONT'D)\n(gasps)\nWith the hat? It's ALL... SO...\nCUTE! Cuteness overload!\nPuss and Kitty stand nose to nose, eyes shimmering. Dog\nstaggers, swoons, and finally PASSES OUT, overdosed on\ncuteness.\nPUSS\nCan we look at the map now?\nKitty relents. They roll Dog out of the way and spread the\nmap on the ground. Stardust begins to swirl across it,\ninscribing another rhyme.\nKITTY\n(reading)\n\"Follow this enchanted chart, it\nknows your path and knows your\nheart.\"\nGlowing AVATARS appear at the top of the map: tiny figures\nrepresenting Puss, Kitty, and Dog.\nPUSS\n(points at avatars)\nIs that us?\nPuss touches the map."

The poor woman starts to howl,\nkicking the old man and tearing at her hair in despair.\nThen:\nRUBINSTEIN'S VOICE\nBoys, keep your peckers up!

No mob any more, but\npeople come and go - jewish policemen, shupos, a few jews.\nAlmost continuous sounds of distant shots and screams.\nThen, Heller appears at the entrance, looks this way and\nthat and goes back inside the building. Szpilman alert.\nAgain Heller appears in the entrance. He beckons someone\ninside. Henryk shuffles out. Heller shoves him into the\nstreet. Henryk stumbles, falls.\nSzpilman runs to him, helps him to his feet.\nHENRYK\n(immediately on the\nattack, furious)\nYou go to Heller, did I ask you to\ntalk to him?\nSZPILMAN\nYou're out, aren't you?\nThey start to walk."
